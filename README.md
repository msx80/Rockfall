I made Rockfall, a simple videogame for the RI5 hub. Which was renamed MindBoy since it's now an handheld videogame :) Not a good one since it has a 5x5 pixel display! But a simple game could be made.

Sources are about 160 lines of Python. It has multiple levels, each one is faster and has more rocks. At the end it gives you the score (that is, how many rocks you avoided).

How to play:

Open the rockfall.py file and copy/paste it into a new Python project in the Mindstorm app. Click play!

Thanks for playing!
